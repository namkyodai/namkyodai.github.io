Copyright shall always be of the original authors. I copied this in Markdown format for personal reference purpose when working with DAO2016 Compliance Assessment Projects funded by Manila Water for more than 20 Wastewater Treatment Plants (STP). Most of the STPs are SBR plants contructed many years ago and are likely not providing adequate level of service regarding the nutrient extraction capacity to satisfy the regulatoryâ€™s standards.

["foreword.html", "Foreword", " Foreword This document is designed to be used by municipalities, engineers, regulators, operators, and other interested parties that use, design, or are thinking about implementing sequencing batch reactor (SBR) wastewater treatment systems. This document highlights enhancements to the design and operation of SBRs that will ultimately provide more effective wastewater treatment. This document can be used by municipalities in the process of planning to upgrade their current operations or reviewing treatment plant options, regulators that review SBR designs, and design engineers. It is worth noting that many considerations should go into choosing whether or not to implement an SBR treatment system. Decisions should not be based solely on economics; they should also include process flexibility, ability to meet permit limits, and long-term viability. In developing this document, a literature review was conducted to obtain current information on SBRs. Reference information is provided to allow users to obtain source documentation for additional details. This reference was written to provide general information on SBR enhancements, and the recommendations will not apply to every SBR design. The document is not meant to be a substitute for professional advice in situations where it is warranted. SBRs are complex treatment systems that must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If the information provided here does not specifically and sufficiently address your problem or concern, consult with industry professionals, service representatives, or regulatory officials. If you find any mistakes or omissions, please notify NEIWPCC by using the feedback form provided at the end of this document. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction TR-16 Guides for the Design of Wastewater Treatment Works is one of the most requested documents produced by the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission. However, there is a need for supplemental information to address the design of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) wastewater treatment facilities. SBRs are becoming popular wastewater treatment options in New England and across the country due to their ability to treat varying flow rates and allow control flexibility. In addition, they have a small footprint and are potentially less expensive to construct and operate. Recognizing the need to address issues associated with the design and operation of SBR facilities, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Technical Assistance Section requested that NEIWPCC initiate this guide. NEIWPCC began by developing a 40-question survey and sending it to SBR facility operators in New England and New York. The survey questions covered design parameters, methods to improve overall plant function, type of discharge permit, and plant set-up. Responses received from the survey verified state concerns that there is no general design that is common to SBR facilities. After the survey results were compiled, the next step in the development of this guide was to visit five SBR facilities in New England. The plants visited were chosen based on their unique characteristics, which included: A newly designed plant A plant at full capacity A plant with a varying wastewater flow rate A larger SBR plant with steady flow A plant receiving seasonally varying flows At these facilities, operators, superintendents, design engineers, and laboratory technicians were interviewed. These visits provided valuable first-hand information on how these plants were operating and the types of adjustments made to operate at optimal conditions. The goal of this document is to provide design considerations and operational information to enhance SBR performance. The guide is also an attempt to optimize SBR design and describe specific configurations and processes that will enhance treatment performance. "]
