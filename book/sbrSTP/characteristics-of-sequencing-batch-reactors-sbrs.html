<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Characteristics of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs)</h1>
<p>SBRs are used all over the world and have been around since the 1920s. With their growing popularity in
Europe and China as well as the United States, they are being used successfully to treat both municipal
and industrial wastewaters, particularly in areas characterized by low or varying flow patterns.
Municipalities, resorts, casinos, and a number of industries, including dairy, pulp and paper, tanneries
and textiles, are using SBRs as practical wastewater treatment alternatives.</p>
<p>Improvements in equipment and technology, especially in aeration devices and computer control
systems, have made SBRs a viable choice over the conventional activated-sludge system. These plants
are very practical for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In areas where there is a limited amount of space, treatment takes place in a single basin
instead of multiple basins, allowing for a smaller footprint. Low total-suspended-solid values
of less than 10 milligrams per liter (mg/L) can be achieved consistently through the use of
effective decanters that eliminate the need for a separate clarifier.</p></li>
<li><p>The treatment cycle can be adjusted to undergo aerobic, anaerobic, and anoxic conditions in
order to achieve biological nutrient removal, including nitrification, denitrification, and some
phosphorus removal. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels of less than 5 mg/L can be
achieved consistently. Total nitrogen limits of less than 5 mg/L can also be achieved by
aerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrates (nitrification) and anoxic conversion of nitrates to
nitrogen gas (denitrification) within the same tank. Low phosphorus limits of less than 2 mg/L
can be attained by using a combination of biological treatment (anaerobic phosphorusabsorbing
organisms) and chemical agents (aluminum or iron salts) within the vessel and
treatment cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Older wastewater treatment facilities can be retrofitted to an SBR because the basins are
already present.</p></li>
<li><p>Wastewater discharge permits are becoming more stringent and SBRs offer a cost-effective
way to achieve lower effluent limits. Note that discharge limits that require a greater degree of
treatment may necessitate the addition of a tertiary filtration unit following the SBR treatment
phase. This consideration should be an important part of the design process.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Common SBR Characteristics</h2>
<div id="general" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> General</h3>
<p>SBRs are a variation of the activated-sludge process. They differ from activated-sludge
plants because they combine all of the treatment steps and processes into a single basin, or
tank, whereas conventional facilities rely on multiple basins. According to a 1999 U.S.
EPA report, an SBR is no more than an activated-sludge plant that operates in time rather
than space.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-treatment-process" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Basic Treatment Process</h3>
<p>The operation of an SBR is based on a fill-and-draw principle, which consists of five
steps—fill, react, settle, decant, and idle. These steps can be altered for different
operational applications.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div id="fill" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.1</span> Fill</h4>
<p>During the fill phase, the basin receives influent wastewater. The influent brings food to
the microbes in the activated sludge, creating an environment for biochemical reactions to
take place. Mixing and aeration can be varied during the fill phase to create the following
three different scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Static Fill</strong> – Under a static-fill scenario, there is no mixing or aeration while the
influent wastewater is entering the tank. Static fill is used during the initial start-up
phase of a facility, at plants that do not need to nitrify or denitrify, and during lowflow
periods to save power. Because the mixers and aerators remain off, this scenario
has an energy-savings component.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Fill</strong> – Under a mixed-fill scenario, mechanical mixers are active, but the
aerators remain off. The mixing action produces a uniform blend of influent wastewater and biomass. Because there is no aeration, an anoxic condition is
present, which promotes denitrification. Anaerobic conditions can also be achieved
during the mixed-fill phase. Under anaerobic conditions the biomass undergoes a
release of phosphorous. This release is reabsorbed by the biomass once aerobic
conditions are reestablished. This phosphorous release will not happen with anoxic
conditions</p>
<p><strong>Aerated Fill</strong> – Under an aerated-fill scenario, both the aerators and the mechanical-
mixing unit are activated. The contents of the basin are aerated to convert the anoxic
or anaerobic zone over to an aerobic zone. No adjustments to the aerated-fill cycle
are needed to reduce organics and achieve nitrification. However, to achieve
denitrification, it is necessary to switch the oxygen off to promote anoxic conditions
for denitrification. By switching the oxygen on and off during this phase with the
blowers, oxic and anoxic conditions are created, allowing for nitrification and
denitrification. Dissolved oxygen (DO) should be monitored during this phase so it
does not go over 0.2 mg/L. This ensures that an anoxic condition will occur during
the idle phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="react" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.2</span> React</h4>
<p>This phase allows for further reduction or “polishing” of wastewater parameters. During
this phase, no wastewater enters the basin and the mechanical mixing and aeration units
are on. Because there are no additional volume and organic loadings, the rate of organic
removal increases dramatically.</p>
<p>Most of the carbonaceous BOD removal occurs in the react phase. Further nitrification
occurs by allowing the mixing and aeration to continue—the majority of denitrification
takes place in the mixed-fill phase. The phosphorus released during mixed fill, plus some
additional phosphorus, is taken up during the react phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="settle" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.3</span> Settle</h4>
<p>During this phase, activated sludge is allowed to settle under quiescent conditions—no
flow enters the basin and no aeration and mixing takes place. The activated sludge tends
to settle as a flocculent mass, forming a distinctive interface with the clear supernatant.
The sludge mass is called the sludge blanket. This phase is a critical part of the cycle,
because if the solids do not settle rapidly, some sludge can be drawn off during the
subsequent decant phase and thereby degrade effluent quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="decant" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.4</span> Decant</h4>
<p>During this phase, a decanter is used to remove the clear supernatant effluent. Once the
settle phase is complete, a signal is sent to the decanter to initiate the opening of an
effluent-discharge valve. There are floating and fixed-arm decanters. Floating decanters
maintain the inlet orifice slightly below the water surface to minimize the removal of
solids in the effluent removed during the decant phase. Floating decanters offer the
operator flexibility to vary fill and draw volumes. Fixed-arm decanters are less expensive
and can be designed to allow the operator to lower or raise the level of the decanter. It is
optimal that the decanted volume is the same as the volume that enters the basin during
the fill phase. It is also important that no surface foam or scum is decanted. The vertical
distance from the decanter to the bottom of the tank should be maximized to avoid
disturbing the settled biomass.</p>
</div>
<div id="idle" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.5</span> Idle</h4>
<p>This step occurs between the decant and the fill phases. The time varies, based on the
influent flow rate and the operating strategy. During this phase, a small amount of
activated sludge at the bottom of the SBR basin is pumped out—a process called wasting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="continuous-flow-systems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Continuous-Flow Systems</h3>
<p>SBR facilities commonly consist of two or more basins that operate in parallel but single-
basin configurations under continuous-flow conditions. In this modified version of the
SBR, flow enters each basin on a continuous basis. The influent flows into the influent
chamber, which has inlets to the react basin at the bottom of the tank to control the
entrance speed so as not to agitate the settled solids. Continuous-flow systems are not true
batch reactions because influent is constantly entering the basin. The design
configurations of SBR and continuous-flow systems are otherwise very similar. Plants
operating under continuous flow should operate this way as a standard mode of operation.
Ideally, a true batch-reaction SBR should operate under continuous flow only under
emergency situations.</p>
<p>Plants that have been designed as continuous-inflow systems have been shown to have
poor operational conditions during peak flows. Some of the major problems of
continuous-inflow systems have been overflows, washouts, poor effluent, and permit
violations.</p>
