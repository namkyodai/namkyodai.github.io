      <title>Review on Boox Note 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/etc/booxnote2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I must say that this e-ink device looks pretty nice. 10.3 inc is perfect for me as I have tons of books in PDF and I particularly read quite a number of scientific/research papers. I have been looking for a device like this with reasonable cost for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide a full details pretty soon, right after the PSL, the retailer who sell this product on Lazada Philippines, exchange for me a new one as the current one has a defect that forcing the devide to restart or reboot every few minutes when turning on wifi for internet browsing and using Android app. I have been contacting with Onyx book customer team, they did send me the updated firmware and I installed it. However, the problem has not been solved. PSL understands this fact since I reported to them within few days after receiving it and they are kindly accepting me to return it and exchange for a new one. However, due to covid-16, their office in QC is partially closed, only open within a few time window in a week so till now I still have not received the replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this critical issue, i think it is only a random error, the device itself is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindy bear with me sometimes after I receive a new one and try it again then I will post my review for those who desparately wanna have this note 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a copy of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neiwpcc.org/neiwpcc_docs/sbr_manual.pdf&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; published by NEWIPCC. Copyright shall always be of the original authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied this in Markdown format for personal reference purpose when working with DAO2016 Compliance Assessment Projects funded by Manila Water for more than 20 Wastewater Treatment Plants (STP). Most of the STPs are SBR plants contructed many years ago and are likely not providing adequate level of service regarding the nutrient extraction capacity to satisfy the regulatory&#39;s standards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technical Due Diligence (TDD)</title>
      <link>/post/tdd/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale&#34;&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical Due Diligence (TDD) is an engineering management process for evaluation and assessment on operation and condition of assets of engineering systems (e.g. buildings, industrial plants, factories). TDD can be considered as a simple application of the Asset Management Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy/Acquire the property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute an intervention strategy/program for the targeted engineering systems at a set of points in time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD is usually done in a quick fashion by a team of a few senior engineers and specialists who understand the targeted engineering systems. The team will normally visit the site/office to perform visual inspection and desktop study on historical records (e.g. as-building drawings, O&amp;amp;M manual, corrective and intervention intervention logbooks). In some case, the work might also involve physical testings for a certain level of audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a TDD work is carried out by implementing a methodology involved assessment on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below gives a quick snapshot on how to deliver the work.
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/techs/tdd0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, Clients might extend a TDD service to include legal and commercial aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to automate the TDD process in my company (Arcadis), I used R to code real examples for a few number of Clients (including a Global Investment Captical Firm and a Japanese company with its main business in railway but wanna to expand into reestate business in the Philippines)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three major projects I worked for these two Clients involves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD and EDD for Hanjin Shipyard in Subic. This shipyard is one of the biggest one in the world. The owner Hanjin has been in bankrupcy since 2018. Till the early 2020, it has been closed, resulting the lost of employment for about 25,000 workers. This job was for a Capital Investment Firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD and asset management study for a 30 storey building in Bonifacio Global City (BGC) (a Japanese railway firm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD and asset management for estate water facilities for Manila Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exammple in below link is a fictive one with values being generated randomly for demonstration purpose. The structure of data is of standard one for automation of TDD process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good articles on TDD are&lt;/p&gt;
